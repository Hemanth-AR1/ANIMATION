# ANIMATION

 This project uses C/C++ to create a fun animation of a bus moving through a colorful landscape, teaching basic graphic programming concepts like drawing 
shapes and creating animations. It's a great way to learn about how to make things move on the screen and create exciting visuals.
 The project also demonstrates how to combine simple graphic techniques to create a visually engaging and interactive experience, making it a valuable learning tool for 
those interested in graphical programming
